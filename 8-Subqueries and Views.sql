-- Consider the Country table and Persons table that you created earlier and perform the following: 

USE population;

SELECT * FROM COUNTRY;
SELECT * FROM PERSONS;

-- 1. Find the number of persons in each country. 

SELECT Country_name, COUNT(*)
FROM Persons
GROUP BY Country_name;

SELECT Country_name, COUNT(*) AS Num_Of_Persons
FROM Persons
GROUP BY Country_name;

-- 2. Find the number of persons in each country sorted from high to low. 

SELECT Country_name, COUNT(*) AS Number_Of_Persons
FROM Persons
GROUP BY Country_name
ORDER BY Number_Of_Persons DESC;

-- 3. Find out an average rating for Persons in respective countries if the average is greater than 4.5

SELECT Country_name, AVG(Rating) AS Average_Rating
FROM Persons
GROUP BY Country_name
HAVING AVG(Rating) > 4.5;

-- 4. Find the countries with the same rating as the Italy.

SELECT Country_name
FROM Country
WHERE Id IN (
    SELECT Country_Id
    FROM Persons
    WHERE Rating = (SELECT Rating FROM Persons WHERE Country_name = 'Italy' LIMIT 1)
);

SELECT c.Country_name, p.Fname, p.Lname, p.Rating

WHERE p.Country_Id IN (
    SELECT Country_Id
    FROM Persons
    WHERE Rating = (SELECT Rating FROM Persons WHERE Country_name = 'Italy' LIMIT 1)
);

-- (Use Subqueries) 
-- 5. Select all countries whose population is greater than the average population of all nations.

SELECT AVG(Population) AS Avg_Population FROM Persons;

SELECT Country_name, Population
FROM Country
WHERE Population > (SELECT AVG(Population) FROM Country);
